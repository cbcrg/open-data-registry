Name: ProteinFold Dataset
Description: Compilation of genetic and structure databases and model parameters required to run [AlphaFold2](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold), [ColabFold](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) and [ESMFold](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm) through the [nf-core/proteinfold pipeline](https://nf-co.re/proteinfold). It includes files from popular biological data resources such as UniProt, PDB, MGnify, BFD and other expandable profile databases as well as parameters from pre-trained deep learning models specialized in predicting highly accurate protein structures from protein sequences.
